For this task, you will be required to explore a research stream that interests you. The literature review serves both as a foundation for your own research and an opportunity to critically analyze existing literature. Submit a written report summarizing the literature review, including critiques and your proposed research questions. Additionally, you will need to record a brief presentation (around 5-10 minutes) summarizing the key points of your review.
