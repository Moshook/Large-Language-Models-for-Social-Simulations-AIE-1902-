  - Quiz Option I: Fine-Tuning a Pre-trained Generative Language Model
  - Quiz Option II: Simulating a Social Phenomenon with 100+ LLM Agents
- Take-home Format: This is a take-home quiz, meaning you can use online resources, such as web searches or even GPT, to help you find solutions, but make sure to independently work on your answers.
