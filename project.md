## Final Project Overview

The individual project is a major component of your final grade, designed to encourage independent research and the application of course methodologies.

- **Research Question**: You will propose a research question (or be assigned one) related to your literature review. Your task is to apply appropriate tools or methods to explore and answer this question effectively.

- **Instructor Assistance**: Throughout the project, the instructor will provide guidance to help you refine your research focus and suggest suitable tools or approaches for investigation.

- **Weekly Updates**: From **Week 7 to Week 13**, you will submit **six weekly progress updates**. These updates should summarize your progress, challenges, and any findings. Each update counts for **3â€“5% of your total grade**, with this section contributing **20%** overall.

- **Final Report & Presentation**: At the end of the semester, you will deliver a comprehensive **final report** detailing your research process, results, and conclusions. In addition, you will give a **final in-class presentation** clearly explaining your research question, methodology, findings, and the impact of your work. The originality and significance of your project will be key aspects of evaluation. This part also contributes **20%** of your final grade.
